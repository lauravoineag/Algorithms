Suggested Recipe

You have twelve items in a collection
I need you to separate the fruit and veg
Then display two lists, with the total cost of fruit and the total cost of veg
And finally the overall price


F: 1.20
V: 0.85
F: 1.05
V: 1.25
F: 0.95
F: 0.85

B: 2.99
B: 1.50 extend to B

V: 0.65
V: 2.30
F: 0.95
F: 1.10
V: 0.65
V: 0.75

foreach item in Collection check if F or V :  + entend for B
if F create F class and add item to F Class
if V create V class and add item to V Class

Total F class items
Total of V class items
Total = TotalF  +  TotalV

LINQ : + extend to V
get all items of type F
add sum of prices
repeat for type V
Add those 2 values together
